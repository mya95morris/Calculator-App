## Overview
The challenge can be found here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29. I completed this challenge in order to help me strengthen my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size.
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I was truly impressed with the complexity of the calculator logic. It was my first project that didn't feel "basic" or easy, and I loved the challenge. It took me a while getting it right, especially if you want to continue adding or multiplying numbers without hitting the equal sign.

Once I perfected the logic, the problem was that I was using setState to keep the accumulator value. I soon realized that since it was an async function, I had to wait until it updated itself in order to continue my process.

## Acknowledgments

Completing the SheCodes Basic workshop, along with other courses and hands on experience inspired me to push through the complex parts of this project. I am a perfectionist, and the time spent working on this project (and making it as PERFECT as possible), FLEW by and was so worth it in the end.
