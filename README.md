### What I learned

I was truly impressed with the complexity of the calculator logic. It was my first project that didn't feel "basic" or easy, and I loved the challenge. It took me a while getting it right, especially if you want to continue adding or multiplying numbers without hitting the equal sign.

Once I perfected the logic, the problem was that I was using setState to keep the accumulator value. I soon realized that since it was an async function, I had to wait until it updated itself in order to continue my process.

## Acknowledgments

Completing the SheCodes Basic workshop, along with other courses and hands on experience inspired me to push through the complex parts of this project. I am a perfectionist, and the time spent working on this project (and making it as PERFECT as possible), FLEW by and was so worth it in the end.
